# 🚀 **Razor Bot** - The High-Frequency Trading Psychopath 🔪  

*A Python MEV bot designed to brute-force token visibility through sheer **transactional violence.***  

---

## **💀 Overview**
Razor Bot doesn’t care about your **P&L**, **gas fees**, or your **fragile emotional state**.  
It has **one goal**:  
**Spam transactions so aggressively that your token trends—whether it deserves it or not.**  

### **Key Highlights**
🔥 **150+ trades per minute** – Who needs a life when you have TPM?  
⚡ **Instant buy/sell cycles** – Because patience is for **cowards**.  
🔄 **Automatic RPC switching** – If an endpoint fails, Razor Bot **gaslights it into working**.  
🕒 **30-minute execution window** – *Like a high-speed car chase, but with more regrets.*  
🛠 **Fails fast, retries instantly** – Razor Bot never gives up. Unlike your dad.  

---

## **🗂 Project Structure**
📂 `razor.py` – Core bot logic, *and where the magic (or chaos) happens.*  
📂 `sell_tokens.py` – Liquidates everything when you **rage quit.**  
📂 `.env` – API key & wallet secrets *(You *did* back those up, right? No? RIP.)*  
📂 `logs/razor_log.txt` – A historical record of your **terrible** decisions.  
📂 `requirements.txt` – Dependencies, so Python doesn’t throw a fit.  

---

## **⚡ Features**
- **🚀 MAXIMUM TPM** – Optimized for absurd transaction counts, *not financial sanity.*  
- **🔄 Direct PumpPortal API Integration** – *Why go anywhere else when we can abuse just one endpoint?*  
- **🔥 High-Speed Execution** – Priority fees cranked up, slippage set irresponsibly high.  
- **🛡 Automatic RPC Failover** – Because servers crash. Razor Bot doesn’t.  
- **💸 Token Liquidation** – Need out? Sell everything in a **beautiful act of desperation.**  
- **📊 Full Logging** – So you can read about your **failures** in great detail.

## **⚙ Setup Instructions**
### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If that fails, congrats—you’re already struggling.  

### **Step 2: Configure API & Wallet**  
Open `.env` and insert your details:  
```
PUMPPORTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  
WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_here  
```
🔴 *Warning*: If you share this file publicly, someone else **will** have more fun with your money than you ever did.  

### **Step 3: Ensure You Have Enough SOL**  
Minimum **0.3+ SOL recommended**  
(Because running out mid-bot is like **stalling on the freeway during rush hour**—humiliating and expensive.)  

---
